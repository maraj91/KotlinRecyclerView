# KotlinRecyclerView
In this project I have covered how to make the model class & custom adapter in using kotlin for RecyclerView.
# Model Class
In kotlin to create the model class use the <b>data class</b> it's same as the pojo class in java.But there is the advantage that
you have to create the model class just using the single line & it will work like the java pojo getter/setter methods.

          data class UserData(val item: Strings, val name: String, val address: String)
